# Dependencies

`sudo apt install libudev-dev libhidapi-dev`

# Extracting firmware

You can download the OWON firmware from the following repo:

[https://github.com/florentbr/OWON-VDS1022](https://github.com/florentbr/OWON-VDS1022)

It may also be extracted from the official OWON software, under the `fpga` folder. If you are not running Windows, instead of running the installer you can actually use `7z` to decompress the installer and extract the files.
